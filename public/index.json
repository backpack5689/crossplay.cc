[{"content":"Hey everyone!\nI just wanted to take a second to thank you for your continued support of the Lorecraft server.\nWe are now 2 years + into this server, and it only keeps getting better and better. While I do recognize that there have been some changes and big events during our time through this year, I\u0026rsquo;m extremely happy to call you all friends. I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see what 2024 will bring.\nA quick look back at 2023, we have:\nOrganized our first (and hopefully not last) meetup for January 13th Gained a multitude of new players Restructured the Admin team to allow for more agile and quicker responses Slight-ly huge amounts of lore and drama Coded an entire custom application to assign active player roles Hosted 3 different elections Funded the server for an entire year (a total of $432.00) For 2024, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that we will be able to get back to grass roots. We have consolidated our current system for dealing justice with the removal of SWAG and some internal admin policies, hopefully leading to a better and less frustrating system of Justice. Furthermore, we have also opened a suggestion box that is checked by anyone on our team, and we encourage any players that want to bring something up to reach out to us, either via DM or through the box.\nIf you have any suggestions for our 2024 year, please let us know! We are looking forward to having you all for another year of fun and lore! Happy Crafting!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/2023_wrapup/","summary":"A quick thank you for the support in 2023.","title":"Thank you for 2023!"},{"content":" Even after more than a week of what has been described as an “exhausting” and “harrowing” election cycle, LoreCraft voters still won’t get any relief from the political process for at least a few more days. Friday morning, the hotly contested Attorney General election ended in an EXACT TIE between candidates Toria and LucyWolfie. They are now expected to both serve as Attorneys General at the same time, contingent on Resolution 21 passing in SWAG.\nThe final tally was 23 votes for Toria (48.9%), 23 votes for LucyWolfie (48.9%), and 2 votes for “none of these candidates” (2.2%). Notably, 89% of eligible voters turned out to cast their votes, leaving few undecided voters left for either campaign to persuade.\n“There were so many things happening with people dropping out, having to get the video edited, posting news articles, admins leaving. It was tough,” admin trailhopper27 explained. “And all of it to end in a tie? While I\u0026rsquo;m happy and love the democratic process, this election period has by far been the roughest time period for myself as an administrator that I\u0026rsquo;ve had to weather.”\nMany have noted that this particular election has been a uniquely exhausting one, unlike the relatively peaceful Server Leader election in April. Four players– ratat0ing, Toria, LucyWolfie, and Unknown_ErrorXD– declared their candidacy for Attorney General, squaring off in a live debate on Sunday which lasted two hours. Unknown_ErrorXD, a self-described unserious candidate, dropped out of the race live at the debate.\nThe debate was followed by escalating attacks between the campaigns, mostly from the ratat0ing camp. But ratat0ing’s seemingly unstoppable rise in the polls was dealt a death blow when Unknown_ErrorXD claimed that ratat0ing had leveraged his admin powers to pressure her to drop out of the race. Further adding to the chaos, in response to the allegations, admin trailhopper27 and Server Leader YourLuckyStars7 decided to start the election without ratat0ing on the ballot, leading to cries of corruption and election tampering from ratat0ing and his supporters. The election workers eventually relented and canceled the tainted ballot, but the damage was done. ratat0ing dropped out in disgrace and later stepped down from his long-held position as server administrator.\n“I realized that the only way to free myself from this dishonor– abuse of power or perception thereof– was to give up power entirely,” ratat0ing lamented in his letter of resignation.\nSo that left the field with two candidates: Toria and LucyWolfie. While Toria had spent hours arguing her policies at the debate, LucyWolfie had been unable to make it that night– which may have ultimately been the reason for her meteoric rise. Lucy soon shot up in the polls, with many voters citing her friendliness and helpfulness as reason for their support. While LucyWolfie rallied her friends and supporters in Cubiza, Kintenko, and elsewhere, Toria worked to maintain her fragile coalition of Commune members and ex-ratat0ing voters.\nWith the server holding its breath Friday afternoon, the vote ended in a deadlock. A perfectly tied election was unprecedented, leaving server leadership scratching their heads for an answer. Admin trailhopper27 punted the question to the ServerWide Association of Gamers (SWAG). Soon, Resolution 21 proposed that, in the event of any tied election, both candidates would win and serve in the position simultaneously. Resolution 21 is expected to pass on Monday. This time next week, Toria and LucyWolfie will both be Attorneys General.\ntrailhopper27 commented, “While it was exhausting, I can\u0026rsquo;t negate the fact that I have loved the player engagement so far, and I hope it continues on in the future.”\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/report_ag_election_tie/","summary":"Two Attorneys General?!

In a statement, Cleric explained, “\u0026hellip;with the construction of the Archives and the responsibilities and projects that come as Head Archivist, I feel my loyalties have been torn between my comrades and my role. The Archives are neutral ground, open to all, yet the Head Archivist is aligned with a faction. In order to maintain proper neutrality…I am leaving the Commune.”\nWhile an understandable and respectful departure, another announcement appeared a mere two hours later that sparked controversy. Three former communists sent the Commune a statement asking for a “voluntary dissolution,” which raised many concerns.\n“They’re basically saying, ‘We joined a group knowing that if we left, we would lose everything. Now that we left… I can’t face the consequences of my actions, so gimme please.’” exclaimed TheRecycler. “I don’t know if it’s realistic to ask that we split up property and items since that would be difficult with us owning so many things.”\nWhile some feel the intent may be in good faith, others fear ill-will is upon them.\nThe Commune will begin discussions and will put a decision to a vote in the near future.\nWill this be the end of Communism?

This shocking revelation caused some suspicion, and upon further investigation, it was found that Ratat0ing, commonly referred to as ‘Rat’, had previously spoken to Unknown, and planned for her to do this, along with wanting Unknown to attack fellow candidate, Toria, as well.\nThis begs the point to be brought up, that during the debate, candidate Toria brought up that Rat was also an admin and could use it to his advantage, to which Rat responded, “I have never done that, and I would never do that, especially in an elected position.”\nWhen asking for more information from Unknown, she expressed her hesitance about dropping from the election and how she felt pressured due to Ratat0ing’s power as an admin of the Lorecraft server.\nThroughout the conversation with Unknown, she repeatedly stated that she was afraid of Ratat0ing and continued to express concern about Rat attempting to retaliate against her coming forward with this information.\nWith this information, I hope that everyone takes it into consideration when voting for Attorney General.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/expose_attorney_general_removed/","summary":"After the recent shocking events that occurred during the Attorney General debate yesterday, information involving candidate Ratat0ing has shown corruption after he pressured another candidate, Unknown_Err0rXD, to attack Toria, drop out of the election, and publicly endorse him.","title":"Candidate found to be corrupt, removed from election"},{"content":"We\u0026rsquo;ve been here twice before. The first time a server reset was suggested, it was shut down immediately. People wanted to preserve what they already had. There were long term projects in the works. People had built communities and events and friendships. We had created a whole world together, and a lot of people didn\u0026rsquo;t want to lose that.\nThe second time a reset came up, it passed SWAG, and we started a whole new world. This world. People missed the beginning stages of Minecraft. They missed building the community, and weren\u0026rsquo;t as satisfied by just growing it. They wanted us to be able to do it all over again and see what went differently this time.\nI had been working on a massive project. This was the biggest thing I had ever attempted, and I was excited. I spent seven months digging out a massive hole in the deepslate for this build, and that was just step one. I finished digging two days before we reset the world, and I lost it all.\nI had also been involved in the community on the last world. I got excited for different events, and I loved hearing about what everyone was working on. I spent a ton of time on the server just hanging out. I thought I could carry that over into the new world, or maybe find a new place in the community that was a bit quieter. Instead, I found myself spending less and less time there. I never finished what I lost, and some part of me still hasn\u0026rsquo;t been able to move on to the new things this world has to offer.\nWhen I first joined Lorecraft, I think I assumed this was a world that would be around for a long time. I thought I would get to see it constantly grow, and that I could spend time working on big projects and the like. I got invested in what was going on, because I thought it was going to last. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to lie, I do want to go back to that world and all the things I left unfinished. But there is something more important here, regardless of how this vote goes.\nI think the big question is not about resetting the server to an older version. I think the question should be about whether or not we allow resets in the future. If resets are going to happen, that\u0026rsquo;s great and fine. We should at least warn people when they join so they don\u0026rsquo;t get their hopes up like I did, only to lose it all when they get invested and have to start from scratch. People should know what they are signing up for. And if we choose not to allow resets in the future, then we need to pick a version of the world and stick with it.\nNo one server is going to be able to satisfy every single Minecraft player. Some people really enjoy the beginning stages of the game. They like working their way up to different achievements, building a few things, then starting over again when they run out of steam. Others like me enjoy the long game. They like picking one world and sticking with it, adding more and more every time they log on. Most people will probably fall somewhere in between or outside of that scale. Finding a place where you can get the gaming experience you\u0026rsquo;re looking for is important, which is why I think it is important we decide what kind of server this will be. Will we be staying in one world, or will we reset every so often when we feel it\u0026rsquo;s time? Whatever we decide, we should stick to it and find a way to let new players know before they find themselves in a server that might not suit their interests.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/opinion_subject_res_14/","summary":"One player's opinion on the issue of server resets as a whole.","title":"On the Subject of Resolution 14"},{"content":"Hello all!\nJust a reminder to sign up for spleef!

The commune sprang up and quickly became a true workhorse. A beautiful collaboration between individuals and their diverse talents, coming together to share resources of their own free will and selflessness. What a beautiful community to be a part of.\nAs I ventured out into the world, I discovered other players who had their own ideas about what prosperity looks like. Some decided to claim their own territory. Others decided to build kingdoms. Who was I to question their ways? Some met me with kindness and generosity, while others preferred to stay to themselves.\nThose who were kind to me stuck out. I recall a time I ventured into the Nether all by myself and was lost. A player, not of the commune, generously offered me leather enhanced boots to help me get around and was patient and kind as I learned my way to different portals. Another time, a player graciously offered me food when I was on the brink of death. This player was also not from the Commune. These players did so out of their acts of selflessness and the good of their own hearts. I would love to return the favor to them some day, not out of obligation, or because of fair trade: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a head for a head. No. I wish to pay them back because of their beautiful souls that reached out to me, and in ways that enhanced this temporary life of mine.\nI believe that a world like that is possible, regardless of how you choose to live and interact with others.

Of course, I am talking about the horrendous Resolution 4.\nThe resolution that you see an image of above was proposed by TheRecycler, a commune member. This resolution in and of itself shows a lack of caring of human life, and worse off, a lack of respect for players, period. This simply cannot stand in our server as of today.\nIn an effort to (1) organize the free states against the commune to be able to put up a resistance if necessary, and (2) to facilitate trade between the countries involved, I would like to propose to the states of LoreCraft that we join together, in an alliance group. Currently, I do not have a name for it, nor do I need to become the leader of the group. However, I believe this group to be necessary for our continued survival on the server.\nThis group\u0026rsquo;s main obligation would be to defend one another if we came under attack from the commune, or any other hostile force that appears on the server at any time. This improved security helps us to maintain our ways of life, as they currently stand, and we no longer have to worry about the sun being blotted out by communist arrows.\nThe group\u0026rsquo;s secondary obligation would be to facilitate trade between the country involved. This will end up being a little more difficult to get through, however I was seeing that we could all agree for a town or location in which we could build shoppes, farms, etc., and only allow the countrymen within the group to be able to come in and trade freely. This would not all be free, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know where this would be located, but that would be up for discussion.\nCurrently, this is just an idea in my head. However, I would like to see it come to a reality. Please, don\u0026rsquo;t let fear keep you from joining! We will be stronger together, and as we can see from Resolution 4, it looks like we may need that strength too, as the commune and their communists become more and more bloodthirsty, and continue to disregard human life.\nIf you are interested in joining, please DM @trailhopper27 via discord.

This article was not how we, the Commune, hoped to be introduced to the world. So we humbly ask you, reader, to let go of all your preconceived notions about the Commune and hear us out.\nBut first, allow me to introduce myself. My name is ratat0ing. I am a lifelong member of the Commune. The elevator pitch for our experimental community is that all property is shared by all members. We have one Central Storage building where all items are kept, free to use for all members. But the Commune is so much more than that. We all live by five Pillars, emphasizing values such as collectivism, shared property, democratic decision-making, equality, and mutual trust.\nMrWeish claims that “the Commune is a communist society built on the backs of the working class”. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how our community works. In the Commune, there is no elite or working class, thanks to Pillar #4: “all members are equal in status and power”. We have no leaders. The thriving community you see today is the product of grassroots cooperation among equal members, not capitalistic greed or forced labor imposed by some imaginary elite.\nI’ll be the first to admit that I was originally skeptical about the Commune’s system. Wouldn’t collective property just encourage laziness and freeloading? But to my pleasant surprise, my concerns were proven wrong. When individuals are freed from the incentive of profit, the collective as a whole thrives. That’s why the Commune is the fastest-growing and most cohesive community in the world today. It has been a beautiful thing to watch unfold.\nBut this community can only thrive when individuals do not cheat the system. It’s why we have Pillar #5: “All members must act in good faith, with mutual trust and sincerity of intention, for the good of the Commune”. The instant one individual begins to act out of their own self-interest, the system breaks down. That’s why we in the Commune do not take kindly to outsiders reaping the rewards of the Commune without sowing. All members contribute, all members benefit.\nIn his recent article, MrWeish admits that he bought a diamond chestplate from one of the villagers owned by the Commune, without permission. He was then confronted by my comrades, TheRecycler and TheBeardedCleric. As punishment, MrWeish and my comrades agreed that MrWeish would return eight diamonds to the Commune and allow my comrades to execute him and take his head. The chat logs show that MrWeish agreed to these terms. It’s not like the Communers killed him without his permission.\nMrWeish argues that his purchase from the villager was not theft, since “the items offered by the villagers don’t belong to the Commune, they belong to the villagers. I didn’t steal the villagers from them.” In my mind, it doesn’t matter if the action was technically theft. At its core, it was an example of one individual benefitting from the work of the Commune without contributing work himself. If MrWeish had asked permission first, I’m sure that would have been a whole different story. The Commune has always been willing to share our spoils with outsiders.\nMrWeish, if you’re reading this, let us leave the past in the past and continue in peace. If you ever want to use the Commune’s resources, all you have to do is ask. Maybe someday, if you set aside your capitalistic ways, you can become a part of the beautiful experiment we call the Commune. That goes for everyone. If you want to be part of a vibrant community and never worry about putting food on the table again, we in the Commune welcome you with open arms.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/opinion-give-the-commune-a-chance/","summary":"MrWeish wants you to believe that the Commune is the bad guy.

There, I took my own goods and traded with the villagers for a diamond chestplate. I was quickly confronted by Commune members. Normally the Commune is supposed to vote on major decisions, but in my case, they simply declared me guilty on the spot for theft, no trial whatsoever. I had to pay them back for the chestplate with eight diamonds and was then executed so they could take my head and put it on a spike for the whole world to see. Not only was it humiliating, but it was completely undeserved.\nFor one, I didn’t break any rules. There was no official rule on the server against trading with someone else’s villagers. According to Rule 2 of the Base Rules for Lorecraft, stealing is defined as such: “taking or destroying another player’s private property (items, mobs, etc.) without their permission”. The items offered by the villagers don\u0026rsquo;t belong to the Commune, they belong to the villagers. I didn’t steal the villagers from them. I made a completely legitimate trade with a villager, an item for an item. The Commune came in as an illegal third party and intimidated me to give them payment they were NOT due.\nSince I’m a new player, I didn’t know the rules of the server very well. When the Commune members came to intimidate me, they convinced me that I had somehow broken a rule and that I had to pay up. They took advantage of me and continued to humiliate me by putting my head on a spike for the whole world to see. It goes without saying that I also lost many levels when they brutally executed me, just another punishment for a crime I didn’t commit.\nWith this all being said, it is my firm belief that I have been wronged, and that all players should beware of the Commune. The rapid armament of their members and the increasingly aggressive threats they type into chat have gotten out of hand. I may have been the first to fall victim to these communists, but I surely won’t be the last.\nI would like to finish by saying that, while this nasty business has certainly created tension, my businesses will still be open to all Commune members, including my planned state-of-the-art casino where guests can gamble to earn hundreds of diamonds and other high-value rewards. This and many more future businesses will soon be opened at the capitalist paradise, which I would like for everyone to consider as neutral ground where they can come to spend their hard-earned valuables. Together, we can build a brighter (and much wealthier) future.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/news/opinion_the_communists_have_gone_too_far/","summary":"Opinion piece on why I was killed by communists, and why I don’t think it was justified.","title":"The Communists Have Gone Too Far"},{"content":"Do you enjoy writing?

Below is a list of the plugins, a quick reference on how to use them, and a link to more documentation.\nGeyser Dynmap Simple Voice Plugin Skoice - Deprecated Geyser Geyser self describes itself on their website here as follows:\nGeyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible to allow for true cross-platform.\nWhile this is something that players won\u0026rsquo;t directly interface with, we decided to put this up for transparency. Geyser will only be noticable to players when it stops working, notably around version updates. When this happens, the admins will wait in the Geyser official discord, and wait until the new version is released in order to fix the bedrock connections.\nDynmap Dynmap is essentially Google Maps for Minecraft, and can be accessed from your browser at map.lorecraft.cc.\nWithin Dynmap, you can claim land by claiming an area. Once you claim land, that land is yours to use as you see fit. Below are some commands to help you get started with claiming an area:\nMove to a corner or point on the outside of the area that you want to claim Type /dmarker add corner Move to the next point on the outside of the area that you want to claim, making a straight line from the last corner Type /dmarker add corner again; this essentially draws a line between the first corner and this one. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have outlined your area After adding the last corner, type /dmarker addarea {label}, replacing the label with whatever you want to name the area Congragulations! You have just claimed an area! This area now shows on the map. If you would like too (and we highly recommend that you do), change the outline color by doing /dmarker updatearea {label} color:#{RRGGBB}, or change the fill color with /dmarker updatearea {label} fillcolor:#{RRGGBB}. You can even change the opacity by doing /dmarker updatearea {label} fillopacity:{0.0-1.0}, where 0 is transparent and 1 is completely filled.\nYou can also add individual icons to the map as well. This could be for shops, or whatever you like! You can add a marker to the map by doing /dmarker addicon id:{ID} {label} icon:{icon}. The list of icons that you can choose from can be found below:\nWant to dive even deeper in Dynmap? Their wiki can be found at this link.\nSimple Voice Plugin \u0026ldquo;Simple Voice Chat\u0026rdquo; is a proximity voice chat system that doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on discord, but instead is fully used and operated within Minecraft. It\u0026rsquo;s even the same one used in HermitCraft!\nBelow you will find instructions for if you\u0026rsquo;re using ATLauncher (trail\u0026rsquo;s personal favorite launcher), or if your using the normal launcher. I recommend you use ATLauncher or an alternative that makes it easy to update mods, but that choice is up to you.\nSVP with ATLauncher If you don\u0026rsquo;t already have a modded instance: Go to \u0026ldquo;Create Pack\u0026rdquo; Click the latest version, and select \u0026ldquo;Fabric\u0026rdquo; as the loader. Then, click \u0026ldquo;Create Instance\u0026rdquo; Go to the instances page and select \u0026ldquo;Add Mods\u0026rdquo; Download the Fabric API by selecting the button under the search bar in the top right. Search for \u0026ldquo;Simple Voice Chat\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;Add Mods\u0026rdquo; section Optional - Search for and install \u0026ldquo;Mod Menu\u0026rdquo; (I have the best luck locating it in Modrinth) That\u0026rsquo;s all! Go ahead and launch your game, and you should see a little icon in the bottom right, that means it\u0026rsquo;s working! You can use the \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo; button to look at what\u0026rsquo;s going on (if you have other mods, you may need to bind this to a different key).\nSVP without ATLauncher Go to the Simple Voice Chat mod on Curseforge and download the latest fabric version of the mod. Go to the Fabric MC Website and download for windows. If you are playing on Mac/Linux, download the universal jar located directly below the button. On Windows, use the Fabric installer you downloaded to download it - ensure you use the same version as the mod you downloaded Open the Microsoft launcher, and select the \u0026ldquo;Fabric Loader\u0026rdquo; installation and \u0026ldquo;Play\u0026rdquo; Now go to \u0026ldquo;Run\u0026rdquo; and type: %appdata% You can also press the Windows Key (⊞) + R key to open the Run box Then go to Roaming/.minecraft/mods If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t show up, just make a folder in .minecraft called \u0026ldquo;mods\u0026rdquo; Drag the Java file for the mod into this folder Start minecraft! Fabric MC Website Skoice Note: Skoice has now been deprecated by our server. Please utilize Simple Voice Plugin for proximity chat\nSkoice is essentially in-game voice chat, that is powered by discord. It uses a custom-built discord bot, along with a plugin to the server, in order to tell your position to other players, and if you are within 50 blocks of another player, you will be put in a special voice chat.\nThere is some first time setup that you have to do in order to utilize the plugin. Follow below to get Skoice linked:\nJoin the minecraft server Type /link in Discord Please utilize the #bots channel in discord, as most users have this muted You should receive a DM from Skoice with a code; copy the token from the DM With your player in the server, type /skoice link {token} Congrats! You\u0026rsquo;ve linked your skoice and minecraft account! Now, to utilize the proximity voice chat, join the local voice chat. Skoice will mute you as soon as you join. If you get close to another player also in local, Skoice will move you to a freshly created voice chat, and unmute you both so you can chat! Once out of proximity again, Skoice will mute you and move you back to the local voice chat.\nWant to learn more?

We are so excited to have you joining our server!\nThe goal of this guide is to be a one-stop-shop for how to interact with the server, and how to get started in the world! Due to the amount of world building, and the massive amount of players able to join, our admin team has developed this guide to help you quickly get into the game!\nThere are 4 steps that we are going to go through today, that when completed, you should be completely ready to join! Feel free to click on any of the items below to jump to that section.\nJoining the Discord Getting on the Whitelist Joining the Game Let\u0026rsquo;s jump into those now!\nJoining the Discord Discord is one of the central places that the world building and community of our server can be seen. Members have the ability to communicate together and plan events, all from the server! It also houses the main mechanism to making changes to the server - SWAG - which we will discuss later.\nTo begin with, click this link to join the discord server. If you do not already have a discord account, you can create one at this link. In case you are brand new to discord, here is a video outlining the basics of discord in 148,000 milliseconds or less.\nNow that we have an understanding of how to interact with Discord, how does LoreCraft work? There are a couple channels that should be findable at all times. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of them!\n#welcome - A channel for all the system messages. Any new users that join will have a message here notifying the rest of the server #links - This channel is all the links that a user may need for the server. It contains links to maps, important plugins, and other such items! #system-notifications - Are you having an issue with the server? There may be a message about that in this channel! It mainly pertains to the systems that Lorecraft hosts, so the map, server itself, or the webpage #announcements - This is the server that admins will use to communicate changes or poll users. #funding - Our minecraft server is crowd funded. Each month, we require a certain amount of money from the community in order to operate the server. If the amount isn\u0026rsquo;t reached, the server could go down at the end of the billing cycle. Dontations are not expected, however they are apreciated and required to keep the server running! There is only 1 more channel that I haven\u0026rsquo;t mentioned yet, as it is the next topic of conversation!\nGetting on the Whitelist The #get-whitelisted channel is specifically for getting your user account on the whitelist! We utilize a whitelist to limit individuals that are not a part of the server from joining, as well as using it to limit users from joining if there is an issue.\nDepending on which version of Minecraft you use, the process may be slightly different. Java users should send their minecraft username in the channel. For Bedrock users, connect first to the server at mcb.lorecraft.cc, and then when it says \u0026ldquo;Not whitelisted\u0026rdquo;, then send a message in the #get-whitelisted channel. This allows the server to know the bedrock user exists, and therefore can be whitelisted. If this is not completed, the whitelist may not work.\nWhile you\u0026rsquo;re waiting to be whitelisted, now would be a good time to continue reading the next 2 sections, the Rules and the Plugins!\nJoining the Game Once you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten on the whitelist, there\u0026rsquo;s not much else to do! You can join the server at either mc.lorecraft.cc for Java players, and mcb.lorecraft.cc for Bedrock players. If you have the time, we would highly recommend reading through the Rules on the rules page, where we outline the different plugins and rules that have been created by the rest of the players. I would also highly recommend going to the news section as well to learn about developments in the current world.\nWe hope you enjoy the game! We are so happy that you were able to join, and we can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see what you\u0026rsquo;ll create!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/starting_out/","summary":"","title":"Quick Start"},{"content":"Layout of SWAG In order to propose and vote on Serverwide Association of Gamer (SWAG) resolutions, a player must be considered \u0026ldquo;active\u0026rdquo;.

If a player is not active, they may not vote on or propose resolutions until they are active.\nVotes within SWAG Once a resolution is proposed, players will have 72 hours to cast their vote. Votes are cast by reacting with a \u0026#x1f44d; or a \u0026#x1f44e; reaction on the resolution. For resolutions not pertaining to SWAG or World Resets only require a simple majority of votes to pass (50% + 1).
