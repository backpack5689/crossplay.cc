Our server typically takes a bit before we can update to the latest version. This occurs due to requiring certain mods (like [GeyserMC](https://geysermc.org/) or [Paper](https://papermc.io/)) in order for the server to function properly. That does, however, cause issues with bedrock.

The biggest issue is due to the fact that most platforms auto-update, meaning that they will update the Minecraft application in the background, without you noticing. And the worst part is -- there's no way to roll it back.

## Windows

1. Open the Microsoft Store.
2. Go to "Settings".
3. Turn `Update apps automatically` to `Off`

## iOS

1. Go to Settings.
2. Go to App Store.
3. Find Auto Updates and switch to `Off`.
