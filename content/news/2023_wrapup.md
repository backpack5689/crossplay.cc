Hey everyone!

I just wanted to take a second to thank you for your continued support of the Lorecraft server.

We are now 2 years + into this server, and it only keeps getting better and better. While I do recognize that there have been some changes and big events during our time through this year, I'm extremely happy to call you all friends. I can't wait to see what 2024 will bring.

A quick look back at 2023, we have:

- Organized our first (and hopefully not last) meetup for January 13th
- Gained a multitude of new players
- Restructured the Admin team to allow for more agile and quicker responses
- Slight-ly huge amounts of lore and drama
- Coded an entire custom application to assign active player roles
- Hosted 3 different elections
- Funded the server for an entire year (a total of $432.00)

For 2024, I'm hoping that we will be able to get back to grass roots. We have consolidated our current system for dealing justice with the removal of SWAG and some internal admin policies, hopefully leading to a better and less frustrating system of Justice. Furthermore, we have also opened a suggestion box that is checked by anyone on our team, and we encourage any players that want to bring something up to reach out to us, either via DM or through the box. 

If you have any suggestions for our 2024 year, please let us know! We are looking forward to having you all for another year of fun and lore! Happy Crafting!
