This morning, I awoke at the crisp hour of 5:30 am to my phone blowing up. There was some drama from last night about a cool homeless camp popping up. Upon further inspection of the logs, I noticed that there were some deaths, and decided to ask someone who was on what had happened.

They proceeded to inform me of the RP'ing that had occurred around the homeless camp, and that Jarvin had gotten heated from it. The individual mentioned that some deaths occured, and while they were ok with the death, that I should check with the others. They also mentioned that I should check my house in spawn, as afterwards Jarvin had spent a suspicious amount of time in there, and he was quite heated from the evenings events.

After hearing this, I decided to hop on and investigate. Using CoreProtect, I was able to determine that he did indeed take items from my chest. I then began logging all the items taken, being careful to get evidence as well. Afterwards, I asked the individual and other witnesses where else they saw him that evening, and proceeded to investigate those ares.

Upon inspection of a location within the HCE, I noticed that 1 of the thefts had occurred within 40 minutes of checking that chest, and that it wasn't contained to that night.  With this evidence of thefts occurring, the fact that they were still ongoing, and the possibility of people actually wanting to charge him with murder, I determined it would be best to use the emergency ban, which was noted in the ban statement. In the statement, I said 
> "Emergency Ban (3 days) - Multiple Counts against SWR II (Stealing), and possible counts of SWR III (killing). Court Case Pending".

I then communicated to the server of the ban, and then informed him of the ban. I explained that it was only temporary, and that we would have a trial to determine how everyone would move forward from this event. That message was met with extreme hostility, which then turned to an accusation of YourLuckyStars7 killing him in cold blood. Through talking with witnesses and others at the time, we found through our investigation that **YourLuckyStars7 was NOT guilty of murder**, and that she only acted in self defense. 

Multiple individuals attempted to defuse the situation both in game and over discord, including @thebeardedcleric & @thedoctorhazard (thank you both). @samuel2097 also attempted to discuss with him the actions he had taken, and why we acted as we did. Their attempts to diffuse and explain the situation was met with more hostility however. In these conversations, we also found Prince Jarvin IV to lie multiple times about the events that went on. [*We later received a response via another channel of communication that he did admit to lying about multiple items during the investigation*]

Due to the lies, events on the server, and communication between individuals of the server and Jarvin, we have deemed it best that he remain banned from both the Discord and Minecraft. He has shown to be hostile towards others, and his conduct was not christianly. We have made the concession that if his IRL friend @thedoctorhazard believes him to be reformed, we will invite him back with open arms. However, there is a lot of tension both in the virtual and real world with this scenario, hence our response was discussed with Hazard before we came to such a decision.

For individuals that lost anything due to Prince Jarvin's (aka Vulturpene) actions, we will work to reinstate you with what was stolen. I have gone through and taken an inventory of all the locales that he was spotted in, and will contact those individuals directly if they would like the items back, or compensatory diamonds.

We are deeply saddened that it has come to this, and we ask for prayers for both Prince Jarvin IV, and @thedoctorhazard during this time.
