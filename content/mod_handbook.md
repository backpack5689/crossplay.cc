Welcome to Lorecraft! We are so excited to have you joining our server!

The goal of this guide is to be a one-stop-shop for how to interact with the server, and how to get started in the world! Due to the amount of world building, and the massive amount of players able to join, our admin team has developed this guide to help you quickly get into the game!

There are 4 steps that we are going to go through today, that when completed, you should be completely ready to join! Feel free to click on any of the items below to jump to that section.

- [Joining the Discord](#joining-the-discord)
- [Getting on the Whitelist](#getting-on-the-whitelist)
- [Joining the Game](#joining-the-game)

Let's jump into those now!

## Joining the Discord

Discord is one of the central places that the world building and community of our server can be seen. Members have the ability to communicate together and plan events, all from the server! It also houses the main mechanism to making changes to the server - SWAG - which we will discuss later.

To begin with, click [this link](http://discord.lorecraft.cc) to join the discord server. If you do not already have a discord account, you can create one at [this link](https://discord.com/register). In case you are brand new to discord, here is a video outlining the basics of discord in 148,000 milliseconds or less.

Now that we have an understanding of how to interact with Discord, how does _LoreCraft_ work? There are a couple channels that should be findable at all times. Here's a list of them!

- __#welcome__ - A channel for all the system messages. Any new users that join will have a message here notifying the rest of the server
- __#links__ - This channel is all the links that a user may need for the server. It contains links to maps, important plugins, and other such items!
- __#system-notifications__ - Are you having an issue with the server? There may be a message about that in this channel! It mainly pertains to the systems that Lorecraft hosts, so the map, server itself, or the webpage
- __#announcements__ - This is the server that admins will use to communicate changes or poll users. 
- __#funding__ - Our minecraft server is crowd funded. Each month, we require a certain amount of money from the community in order to operate the server. If the amount isn't reached, the server could go down at the end of the billing cycle. Dontations are not expected, however they are apreciated and required to keep the server running!

There is only 1 more channel that I haven't mentioned yet, as it is the next topic of conversation!

## Getting on the Whitelist

The #get-whitelisted channel is specifically for getting your user account on the whitelist! We utilize a whitelist to limit individuals that are not a part of the server from joining, as well as using it to limit users from joining if there is an issue.

Depending on which version of Minecraft you use, the process may be slightly different. Java users should send their minecraft username in the channel. For Bedrock users, connect first to the server at `mcb.lorecraft.cc`, and then when it says "Not whitelisted", then send a message in the #get-whitelisted channel. This allows the server to know the bedrock user exists, and therefore can be whitelisted. If this is not completed, the whitelist may not work.

While you're waiting to be whitelisted, now would be a good time to continue reading the next 2 sections, the Rules and the Plugins!

## Joining the Game

Once you've gotten on the whitelist, there's not much else to do! You can join the server at either `mc.lorecraft.cc` for Java players, and `mcb.lorecraft.cc` for Bedrock players. If you have the time, we would highly recommend reading through the Rules on the rules page, where we outline the different plugins and rules that have been created by the rest of the players. I would also highly recommend going to the news section as well to learn about developments in the current world.

We hope you enjoy the game! We are so happy that you were able to join, and we can't wait to see what you'll create!
